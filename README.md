# Abstract

This Flutter app, developed using Dart and Android Studio, utilizes the AVD Manager Emulator with a
Pixel 6 API 35 device. It consists of two primary pages: a menu displaying information about shop
branches, including addresses, phone numbers, and websites, and a Google Map page that visually
represents the locations of these branches.
